#### 1. Use an inner join on the `product_id` columns of both the `product_names` table and the `sales` table. From the result of the inner join, select the `model`, `customer_id`, `sales_transaction_date`, `sales_amount`, `channel`, and `dealership_id`, and store the values in a separate table called `product_sales`.
